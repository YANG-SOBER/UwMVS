The code for our physically-guided underwater multi-view image synthesis approach, the synthesized underwater multi-view stereo dataset, real-world underwater images, and the code for the proposed underwater multi-view stereo network will be made available after the paper's acceptance. Meanwhile, all 32 pretrained checkpoints will be released to advance the progress of underwater multi-view stereo research.

We would like to express our gratitude to all the reviewers for their efforts and constructive comments.
